# K-Means Clustering in Machine Learning

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation and analysis of **K-Means Clustering**, an essential unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning datasets into distinct groups based on feature similarity.

## 📌 Overview

K-Means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that aims to partition data into **K distinct non-overlapping clusters**. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squared distances between data points and their corresponding cluster centroids.
